Markdown syntax

__Hello Markdown__!

_Italic version_!

*Italic again*!

But if you surround an * or _ with spaces, itâ€™ll be treated as a literal asterisk or underscore.

Use backslash to escape * or _ in a paragraph: \* This in not emphasized. \*

Note that, blank lines are used to separate paragraphs.

Hard returned lines
are not put in separate paragraphs.
