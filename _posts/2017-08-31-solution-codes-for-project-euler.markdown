I created a new [repo][web_repo] on GitHub to share my solution codes for the problems of [Project Euler][web_pe]. I find it is really interesting.

# Comments on the problems.

* 001
* 002
* 003

A function is created to test whether a positive integer is a prime number.

* 004
* 005

Codes are developed to calculate the least common multiple of a group of numbers.

* 006

There are some interesting facts about the sum of the sequence of n^2. And it turns out that 

(1 + 2 + ... + n)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3. 

Amazing!

* 007

It turns out that in the Python environment if you check the current number to see whether it is a prime number by referring to the prime numbers already found and stored in a list, the overall performance is not as good as expected.

* 008

No magical things happened.

* 009

There is a genius solution in the discussion thread of Project Euler.

* 010

No magical things happened.

* 011

The `diagonal()` and `fliplr()` functions are utilized in my python code. Remember to handle the opposite diagonals.

* 012

Using the prime factorization is the key.

* 013

In fact, only the first 11 or 12 digits of each number are needed if only the first 10 digits of the final answer are required.

Some people say that, in LISP, amazing things happens when solve this problem with only one "+" operator.
