# Key Scientific Issues in the Manufacturing of a Reactor Coolant Pump #

## Sub-project: Safety assessment of the rotor components ##

# Overview

This is a government funded research project, a relatively larger one. Our research group mainly took part in the sub-project "Safety assessment of the rotor components".

The target reactor coolant pumps (RCP) fall into two categories, which we gave them fancy names as: shaft seal RCP[1] and canned motor RCP[2].



We were doing research aiming at these two kinds of RCPs. The tasks of this sub-project include

* Rotordynamics.
* Mechanical issues about the flywheel.
* Cracks on shaft due to mechanical and thermal loads.
* Electromagnetic properties of the motor.

# My tasks

The tasks assigned to me are mostly about the rotordynamics of the RCPs, particularly the experimental study. A model pump was designed by myself and its rotordynamics was tested. I also developed a Maltab code to calculate the supporting effects of running clearances in pump and to solve the rotordynamics characteristics of the RCP.

The experimental work mainly focused on the vibration of the pump rotor. I measured the trajectory of the rotor, recorded the vibration level on the supporting structure and bearing housing. The model pump is actually based on a canned motor pump. Unlike a conventional canned motor pump which circulates its internal flow by an auxiliary impeller, the model pump had its internal flow propelled by external fluid source.
