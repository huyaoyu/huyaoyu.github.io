# Scaled Model Molten Salt Pump for Molten Salt Reactor. Its Design and Safety Analysis.

A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of generation IV nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. MSRs can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapor pressure.\[1\]

A typical configuration of MSR could be depicted by the following image\[1\]. It has three loops which could be termed as the primary, secondary and third loop. In this configuration, both the primary and secondary loops are filled with high temperature molten salt (500-700℃). In these two loops there are two important pumps and they could be referred as the primary and secondary pumps. In the following image, these two pumps are marked with dashed lines and numbers. These pumps are vital to the safety of the molten salt nuclear reactor system.

Research of molten salt reactor is currently a large government funding project and is leading by Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP), Chinese Academy of Sciences.\[2\] Our team cooperates with SINAP in developing model molten salt pumps (MSP) for early stage reactor test loops.

The following aspects are the particular interests of our team:

(1) Hydraulic performance under design and off-design condition with different rotating speeds and flowrates.

(2) Temperature distribution, limitation and performance of reinforced internal heat exchange.

(3) Possible failure due to mechanical and thermal loads, especially the damage from thermal stress. Optimization of pump structure in order to reduce stress concentration.

(4) Rotordynamic characteristics and stability. Fluid induced forces from internal running clearances. Effects of these clearances and thermal load on the rotordynamics of the pump rotor.
