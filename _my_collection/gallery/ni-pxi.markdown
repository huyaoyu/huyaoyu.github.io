A new NI PXI platform is just arrived, and it is REALLY awesome. 

The hardware consists of

* 2 x Dynamic voltage card with 8 simultaneous channels. 
* 1 x RTD card with 20 channels.
* 1 x Multi-functional card with 32 channels. It could measure electric voltage, current and thermal couple.
* 1 x Switcher panel with 24 output channels and 24 input channels to simulate a PLC.
* 1 x RS485/RS422 communication card.

* Plug a screen, a keyboard and a mouse. Let's rock. &darr;

* After playing with LabView for about 5 minutes, a simple test program is ready. &darr;

In this extremely simple LabView code, two channels are deployed. One is measuring room temperature by an attached thermal couple. The other is measuring the wave form from a signal generator, at a sampling frequency of 100 kHz. The result is quit good.

* AHa, its me again. &darr;
