The above image sequence is obtained from the result of a transient simulation using ANSYS CFX. It is the cross-sectional view of a running clearance between a rotor and a stator. The rotor whirls in an eccentric manner, leading to a rotating and asymmetric pressure distribution. Pressure on rotor surface produces net fluid induced forces. These forces act on the rotor and they could either stabilize or destabilize the rotor according to the geometry parameters and flow conditions of the clearance.

The transient simulation is conducted utilizing the rotating frame and sliding mesh functionalities provide by ANSYS CFX. The annular clearance is divided into two parts. One is stationary and the other is rotating eccentrically. The meshes of these two parts form a sliding mesh interface.
