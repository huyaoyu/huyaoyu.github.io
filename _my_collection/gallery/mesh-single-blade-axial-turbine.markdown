Again x 2, just for fun.

The software is ANSYS ICEM. The mesh consists of pure hexahedral grids. To be honest, the quality of the mesh is not so good. I just use it to do my everyday practice.

* 03 &darr; Mesh at leading edge. Again, the quality is not so good. Maybe I should practice BladeGen and TurboGrid next time.
