# Capture moving bubbles with high speed camera

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/my_collection/gallery/20170111_Bubble_HighSpeedCam_Ex.jpg" alt="<img>bubbles inside a glass tube" width="600px"></p>

This image was taken when my colleague, Yuchen Song, was tuning the high speed camera and trying to capture a clear shot of the moving bubbles inside a transparent tube. The gas and liquid are air and water, respectively. This work was aiming at studying how the bubbles are transported and broken up by the complex turbulent flows.

Further inquiries could be addressed to Yuchen Song \(<songyuchen@sjtu.edu.cn>\).
