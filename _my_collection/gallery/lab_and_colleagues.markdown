# Capture moving bubbles with high speed camera

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/my_collection/gallery/20170111_Bubble_HighSpeedCam_Ex.jpg" alt="<img>bubbles inside a glass tube" width="600px"></p>

This image was taken when my colleague, Yuchen Song, was tuning the high speed camera and trying to capture a clear shot of the moving bubbles inside a transparent tube. The gas and liquid are air and water, respectively. This work was aiming at studying how the bubbles are transported and broken up by the complex turbulent flows.

Further inquiries could be addressed to Yuchen Song \(<songyuchen@sjtu.edu.cn>\).

# Tuning the wind tunnel with fan grid

This image was taken from the experiment site of one of my colleagues, Dr. Yuanwei Ma, when he was working on tuning the fan grid of a wind tunnel. Dr. Ma would like to study the dispersion characteristics of radioactive matter under certain wind field. In the laboratory we use non-radioactive substance instead of real radioactive matter.

Further inquiries could be addressed to Dr. Ma \(<coldtiger@sjtu.edu.cn>\).
